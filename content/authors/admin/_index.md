bio: My research interests are in the field of applied Microeconomics. Before starting my PhD in Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M University (TAMU), I earned my bachelor’s degree in finance from Southwest University of Finance and Economics and spent a year of study in TAMU's Economics Department. This diverse educational background has enabled me to explore a wide range of topics in my research, including portfolio risk management, labor policy, auction theory, and agricultural policies.
